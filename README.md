# GCN-PF: Graph Convolutional Network Integrated Particle Filter for Vocal Melody Extraction
This paper proposes a novel method that integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Particle Filter (PF) for vocal melody extraction. The approach models pitch transition probabilities using a logistic distribution and employs a GCN to estimate the likelihood function for particle weighting. Additionally, a zero-frequency allocation strategy is introduced for unvoiced frame detection during prediction, and a zero-frequency particle revalidation strategy is used during update to reduce unvoiced frame misclassification. This GCN-integrated PF framework enables frame-wise melody inference, combining the strong learning capacity of neural networks with the interpretability and theoretical soundness of Bayesian methods.
